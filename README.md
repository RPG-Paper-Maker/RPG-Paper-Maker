## Overview

RPG Paper Maker is a game making engine, free for non commercial use, allowing you to create a 3D universe with many 2D sprites and even 3D objects using a simple interface for all available platforms: Web browser, Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

The technologies used for this engine are: `React`, `TS`, `HTML/CSS`, `JSON`, `three.js`, `Howler.js`, `Electron.js`.

## :open_file_folder: Project organization

The [organization](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker) contains some independent repositories. If you want to fork several repositories, **you should put them all in the same parent folder root**.

- [RPG-Paper-Maker](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/RPG-Paper-Maker) is the core Game Editor Software (RPG Paper Maker). It is entirely written in `TS` and uses `React`. It is managing all the `.json` files related to a RPM game.
- [Game-Scripts](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/Game-Scripts) is all the Game Scripts used to actually play to a game in RPG Paper Maker. It uses `TS, HTML/CSS, JSON, three.js, Howler.js, Electron.js`. It is also interpreting all the `json` files that are generated by the RPG Paper Maker engine.
- [Game-Scripts-Build](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/Game-Scripts-Build) is the Game Scripts from previous repo but the one generated in `JS` so it can be actually used in a browser and editable by any user in real-time without compiling.
- [Basic-Ressources](https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/Basic-Ressources) contains all the Basic Ressources assets that the users can use for there projects (pictures, musics...).

## How to build the project

### Pre-requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- IDE: we recommend you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- For Windows users only: we recommend to use [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use GIT BASH functionnality to run all the next following commands (right click in desired folder and click on Git Bash). You can also use default Windows PowerShell.

### Build

- Create a folder that will contain all your RPM cloned repos (for now we'll just use this one)

```bash
mkdir RPM
cd ./RPM
```

- Clone the project and go to this repo

```bash
clone https://github.com/RPG-Paper-Maker/RPG-Paper-Maker.git
cd ./RPG-Paper-Maker
```

- Install node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Update and run

- Update the modules (get other independent repos data needed for the engine to run like default assets, game scripts...). You can do it anytime before running the project if any other repos was updated (localy or in git origin)

```bash
npm run update-mods
```

- Run the project

```bash
npm start
```

This should open the project in [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
