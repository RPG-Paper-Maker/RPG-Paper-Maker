They come with their own textures, too. Download or create GLTF/GLB animated models and convert them at https://threejs.org/editor/\n\nFirst, load the model you want into a map object. This will replace the object's mesh (the graphics). You can then offset, rotate, scale and animate the model. The model will stay anchored to a map object. When the map is reloaded, the models revert back to normal. Be careful to fix the object's direction if you want to control it via this plugin only!
